**Problem**: Frontend still used random data for graph visualization
**Fix**:
- Integrated real provenance analysis with frontend
- Added API endpoint for provenance data
- Updated frontend to fetch real relationship data
- Added fallback to simple graph when provenance unavailable
- Enhanced graph visualization with real feature relationships

**Location**: 
- Backend: `interpretability_workbench/server/api.py:977-1003`
- Frontend: `ui/src/components/InterpretabilityWorkbench.tsx:1587-1650`

### **8. Cache Integration (Implemented)**
**Problem**: No caching for expensive operations like inference and provenance analysis
**Fix**:

**Location**: `interpretability_workbench/server/api.py:717-838, 977-1003`

### **9. Comprehensive Testing (Enhanced)**
**Problem**: Limited test coverage for new functionality
**Fix**:
- Added cache endpoint tests
- Added inference caching tests
- Enhanced error handling tests
- Added performance monitoring tests
